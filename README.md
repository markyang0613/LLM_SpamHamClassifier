# LLM_SpamHamClassifier
As an improvement from the previous project on using Logistic Regression to categorize spam emails from ham emails, this time I adopted openAI's API to use ChatGPT3.5 Turbo and trained/fine tuned it to conduct Spam-Ham Classification.
I have also made remarks on the impressive functionality and capacity to bypass all the previous steps that were needed within the field of Data Science in categorizing and analyzing the binary dataset.
